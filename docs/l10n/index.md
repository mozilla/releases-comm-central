# Localization

At Mozilla, localization refers to adapting the user interface and messages
to different cultural and regional needs. Localization is a broader term than
translation because it involves extensive research into the target culture, and
in result touches not only text and UI translation but also cultural adaptation
of icons, communication styles, colors, and UX.

Questions about Thunderbird localization should be directed to the Localization
Coordinator. Contact information is on the
[Thunderbird Project page in Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/info/).
