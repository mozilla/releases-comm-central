Directory ./rnp contains a copy of rnp which has been obtained from:
https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp

[tag v0.17.1]

If MZLA applied patches on top, the version number in file
third_party/rnp/src/lib/version.h will contain a suffix that lists
the upstream pull request IDs.

For licensing information, please refer to the included documentation.

Updates to this copy are managed by "mach vendor". The configuration file
is at rnp/moz.yaml. MIN_RNP_VERSION in RNPLib.sys.mjs is automatically updated
as well.

    > cd comm/third_party/rnp

    # validate the YAML config file
    > mach vendor -v ./moz.yaml
    ./moz.yaml: OK

    # check for new upstream versions
    > mach vendor --check-for-update ./moz.yaml
    v0.17.0 2023-02-27T16:49:53+02:00

    # update to a new version
    > mach vendor -r v0.17.0 ./moz.yaml

    # If there are patches to apply in moz.yaml, the process is a little different
    > mach vendor ./moz.yaml --patch-mode none
    # followed by
    > mach vendor ./moz.yaml --patch-mode only
