# TODO: Remove the default features on next breaking release and make them opt-in.
# Because default features are evil
default = ["std", "async"]

# Enables usage of libstd. Adds support for thread blocking receive methods.
std = []
# Enables async receiving by implementing Future
async = []

# Only used for internal correctness testing.
# Downstream users of oneshot should never enable this feature. Enabling it does nothing.
# To compile oneshot built against loom one must *also* set RUSTFLAGS="--cfg oneshot_loom"

# Benchmarking only dependency. This is hidden behind a `cfg(criterion)` to avoid it being
# pulled in during `cargo test` runs. Mostly because criterion has a much higher MSRV than
# this library, so it becomes impossible to run `cargo test` on the MSRV compiler without
# this hack.
# To run benchmarks, run with `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg criterion" cargo bench`
