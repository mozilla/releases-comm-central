/// Represents the sets of limits an adapter/device supports.

/// We provide three different defaults.
/// - [`Limits::downlevel_defaults()`]. This is a set of limits that is guaranteed to work on almost
///   all backends, including "downlevel" backends such as OpenGL and D3D11, other than WebGL. For
///   most applications we recommend using these limits, assuming they are high enough for your
///   application, and you do not intent to support WebGL.
/// - [`Limits::downlevel_webgl2_defaults()`] This is a set of limits that is lower even than the
///   [`downlevel_defaults()`], configured to be low enough to support running in the browser using
///   WebGL2.
/// - [`Limits::default()`]. This is the set of limits that is guaranteed to work on all modern
///   backends and is guaranteed to be supported by WebGPU. Applications needing more modern
///   features can use this as a reasonable set of limits if they are targeting only desktop and
///   modern mobile devices.
///
/// We recommend starting with the most restrictive limits you can and manually increasing the
/// limits you need boosted. This will let you stay running on all hardware that supports the limits
/// you need.
///
/// Limits "better" than the default must be supported by the adapter and requested when requesting
/// a device. If limits "better" than the adapter supports are requested, requesting a device will
/// panic. Once a device is requested, you may only use resources up to the limits requested _even_
/// if the adapter supports "better" limits.
///
/// Requesting limits that are "better" than you need may cause performance to decrease because the
/// implementation needs to support more than is needed. You should ideally only request exactly
/// what you need.
