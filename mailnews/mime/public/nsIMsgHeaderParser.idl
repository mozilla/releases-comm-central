/**
 * A structured representation of an address.
 *
 * This is meant to correspond to the address production from RFC 5322. As a
 * result, an instance of this interface is either a single mailbox or a group
 * of mailboxes. The difference between the two forms is in which attribute is
 * undefined: mailboxes leave the members attribute undefined while groups leave
 * the email attribute undefined.
 *
 * For example, an address like "John Doe <jdoe@machine.example>" will, when
 * parsed, result in an instance with the name attribute set to "John Doe", the
 * email attribute set to "jdoe@machine.example", and the members variable left
 * undefined.
 *
 * A group like "undisclosed-recipients:;" will, when parsed, result in an
 * instance with the name attribute set to "undisclosed-recipients", the email
 * attribute left defined, and the members variable set to an empty array.
 *
 * In general, the attributes of this interface are always meant to be in a form
 * suitable for display purposes, and not in a form usable for MIME emission. In
 * particular, email addresses could be fully internationalized and non-ASCII,
 * RFC 2047-encoded words may appear in names, and the name or email parameters
 * are unquoted.

/**
 * A utility service for manipulating addressing headers in email messages.
 *
 * This interface is designed primarily for use from JavaScript code; code in
 * C++ should use the methods in MimeHeaderParser.h instead, as it is better
 * designed to take advantage of C++'s features, particularly with respect to
 * arrays.
 *
 * There are two methods for parsing MIME headers, one for RFC 2047-decoded
 * strings, and one for non-RFC 2047-decoded strings.
 *
 * In general, this API attempts to preserve the format of addresses as
 * faithfully as possible. No case normalization is performed at any point.
 * However, internationalized email addresses generally need extra processing to
 * work properly, so while this API should handle them without issues, consumers
 * of this API may fail to work properly when presented with such addresses. To
 * ease use for such cases, future versions of the API may incorporate necessary
 * normalization steps to make oblivious consumers more likely to work properly.
