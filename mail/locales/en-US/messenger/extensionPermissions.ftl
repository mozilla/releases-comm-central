## Extension permission description keys are derived from permission names.
## Permissions for which the message has been changed and the key updated
## must have a corresponding entry in the `PERMISSION_L10N_ID_OVERRIDES` map.
## All localized permissions have to be added to the `PERMISSIONS_WITH_MESSAGE`
## map. Both maps are populated in mail/modules/ExtensionsUI.sys.mjs.
