# Address Book UI

The address book user interface is primarily the address book tab, but there are smaller pieces in
various other parts of Thunderbird.

## Address Book Tab

The address book tab is a tab displaying `about:addressbook` in a `<browser>`. In a similar way to
the mail tab, it consists of three panes: a list of address books, a list of contacts in the
selected address book, and a details pane where contact information can be displayed or edited.

## Recipient Autocomplete

When composing a message, the address book can suggest contacts to autocomplete text typed into the
recipient fields.

## Contacts Sidebar

When composing a message, a sidebar can be opened with a list of contacts. This is useful for
selecting recipients.

## Edit Contact Panel

When displaying a message, each sender or recipient can be clicked on to bring up the Edit Contact
panel. This can be used to quickly save new contacts in the address book or to edit existing
contacts.

## Advanced Search

The address book search dialog is another way of searching through the contacts. It can be accessed
from the main window Edit menu.
