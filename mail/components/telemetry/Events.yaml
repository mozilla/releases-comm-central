# This file contains Thunderbird-specific telemetry Event definitions, which
# are added on top of the Firefox ones (in /toolkit/components/telemetry).
# To avoid name clashes, all the Thunderbird events will be under a "tb"
# category.

# A category used for unit tests.
# Under normal operation, these won't be invoked.
