 * The emptytext style would appear to use italics.  This is causing
 * problems for the search box because it has no minwidth and is flexy, so
 * removing the emptytext causes the size of the box to change and this is silly
 * and undesirable.  This change is being made to maintain the generally
 * accepted status quo while reducing breakage.  This will cause visual
 * inconsistency with the quick filter bar unless it gets a change like this
 * too.
