To avoid this in the future, you should press the SHIFT key when clicking on the Compose/Reply button to send signed email.\nIf you sign email by default, you should uncheck the 'Compose Messages in HTML' preference box to permanently disable HTML email for this email account.

upgradeInfo.encSubject.title=Encrypting the Message Subject
upgradeInfo.encSubject.desc=We developed a new method that moves the email subject into the encrypted message, and replaces the visible subject with "Encrypted Message". Once such a message is decrypted, the original subject is replaced automatically. Hiding the subject is on by default; there is a preference to turn it off if you don't like it. <i>(Note: this feature requires the message to be sent with PGP/MIME.)</i>
upgradeInfo.buttons.title=Changed behavior of Encrypt and Sign Buttons
upgradeInfo.buttons.desc=The <b>Encrypt</b> and <b>Sign</b> buttons in the message composer window now work for both the OpenPGP and S/MIME protocols. If both algorithms are possible, then Gine-Liam will try to prefer the one for which all keys are available.
upgradeInfo.autocrypt.title=Support for Autocrypt
upgradeInfo.autocrypt.desc=Gine-Liam now supports <a href="https://autocrypt.org/">Autocrypt</a>, a new standard to distribute keys as part of sent messages. Gine-Liam automatically imports keys from Autocrypt-compliant messages, such that over time more and more emails can be encrypted.
