# ms_graph_tb

Rust representations of
[Microsoft Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview)
types and basic requests, primarily intended for use with Thunderbird.

This crate is currently under heavy development, and makes no stability
guarantees. The intent is to generate as much of it as practical from the
[OpenAPI representation](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-metadata/blob/master/openapi/v1.0/openapi.yaml).
