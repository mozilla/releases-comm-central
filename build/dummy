This is a dummy file that isn't used.
Its only purpose is to have an irrelevant file that can
be modified whenever we need to trigger a new build,
but no other commits are pending.

Instructions:

If a new build for comm-central is desired, edit this file,
and make change to the whitespace below the line.
(For example, add another empty line, or remove one.)
